# ForestCoverML: Predicting Forest Cover Types with Machine Learning
## Background
Accurate prediction of forest cover types is crucial for understanding ecosystem dynamics, formulating effective conservation strategies, and promoting sustainable forestry management. This project leverages machine learning techniques to classify forest cover types based on environmental features such as elevation, slope, soil type, and proximity to water bodies. By analyzing the "Covertype" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, this project aims to develop a reliable and efficient model for forest cover type prediction.
## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to explore and compare the performance of different machine learning models for forest cover type classification. Specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models. The project also aims to identify the most influential features in predicting forest cover types and provide insights into the ecological processes governing forest distribution.
## Approach
The project involves several key steps:
### Data Preprocessing
The raw dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values (if any), normalize the features, and split the data into training and testing sets. Feature normalization is crucial for ensuring fair comparisons between different features and improving the convergence of machine learning algorithms.
### Feature Selection
To identify the most relevant features for predicting forest cover types, Lasso Regression is employed. Lasso Regression uses L1 regularization to encourage sparsity in the model coefficients, effectively selecting features that contribute most to the prediction.
### Model Training and Evaluation
Three different machine learning models are trained and evaluated using the selected features:
* **Logistic Regression**: This model utilizes a linear combination of features to predict the probability of each forest cover type. It is suitable for binary classification problems but can be extended to multi-class classification through techniques like One-vs-All.
* **Random Forest**: This ensemble learning model combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and robustness. Each tree is trained on a random subset of features, reducing the risk of overfitting and enhancing generalization.
* **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**: This neural network model with multiple hidden layers can capture complex nonlinear relationships between features and classes. The MLP is trained using backpropagation and gradient descent optimization.
The models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices and classification reports provide detailed insights into the model's performance across different forest cover types.
### Model Comparison and Optimization
The performance of the three models is compared, and potential optimizations are discussed. Optimization strategies may include:
* **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjusting parameters like learning rate, tree depth, and hidden layer size to improve model performance.
* **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the model's predictive power.
* **Class Imbalance Handling**: Addressing the imbalance in class distribution through techniques like oversampling or undersampling.
## Results
The Random Forest model demonstrates the highest accuracy, achieving approximately 95.51% on the test set. This model effectively captures the complex relationships between environmental features and forest cover types. Feature importance analysis reveals that factors like elevation and proximity to roads play crucial roles in predicting forest cover types. The MLP model also performs well, achieving an accuracy of 92.29%. The Logistic Regression model, while less accurate, provides valuable insights into the influence of individual features.
## Future Work
Future research can focus on addressing class imbalance issues, exploring more advanced machine learning models like deep learning or graph neural networks, and incorporating additional environmental data sources for improved prediction accuracy.
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning techniques for predicting forest cover types. By understanding the key factors influencing forest distribution, we can make informed decisions to promote forest conservation and sustainable management.
